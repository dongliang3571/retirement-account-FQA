### Why should I contribute to my retirement savings plan?

The money contributed to your retirement savings plan can be tax-advantaged. There are several different types of contributions, each with unique tax advantages.

Contributing pre-tax dollars to your retirement savings plan can reduce your taxable income and leave you with more take-home pay than if you had elected after-tax contributions, or Roth contributions (if your plan allows).

Pre-tax contributions and earnings on those contributions are not taxed until they are withdrawn from the plan. Making pre-tax contributions may be beneficial if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket at retirement.

Roth contributions are made after taxes are withheld from your gross pay and do not reduce your taxable income. However, at the time of distribution, both the contributions and earnings may be withdrawn tax-free, if certain criteria are met.

Contributing after-tax dollars does not reduce your current taxable income yet allows your investment earnings to grow tax-deferred. Withdrawals on contributions are tax-free. Earnings are taxed at the time of withdrawal. In the example below the Federal and State tax rate used is 25% and the contribution rate is 10%.
